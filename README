=== About =====================================================================

  MComix is a user-friendly, customizable image viewer. It is specifically
  designed to handle comic books (both Western comics and manga) and supports a
  variety of container formats (including CBR, CBZ, CB7, CBT, LHA and PDF).
  MComix is a fork of Comix. It is written in Python and uses GTK+ through the
  PyGTK bindings.

=== Installation ==============================================================


  Run "python2 setup.py install" as root. This will install MComix in the
  site-packages folder of Python. An executable "mcomix" will be placed in
  /usr/bin.

  In order to install MComix in another base directory, use the --prefix option.
  The option --user explicitly installs MComix in the user's home directory,
  which does not need root access.

  Example:

      # python2 setup.py --prefix /usr install

  As an example of how to install MComix from the downloaded tar.gz file, run
  as the root user (via su or sudo):

      # tar -xzf mcomix-x.y.tar.gz
      # cd mcomix-x.y
      # python2 setup.py install

  If you don't want to install MComix in some system directory, you can just
  execute the file mcomixstarter.py in the unpacked MComix directory to
  run the program. You could also create a symlink somewhere in your PATH
  pointing to this file.

  Note:

  The above example will not install icons, desktop integration, the
  man page, or other optional files normally placed into /usr/share. To do so,
  setup.py must be called with a additonal options:

      # python2 setup.py install --single-version-externally-managed \
	                            --prefix /usr --root / --record mcomix-files.txt

  This sort of installation is only recommended for advanced users, as no
  simple uninstall procedure exists of yet. All files belonging to MComix will
  be written into mcomix-files.txt, and must be removed manually when MComix
  is to be uninstalled.

=== Dependencies ==============================================================

  MComix needs Python 2.5, Setuptools 0.6, PyGTK 2.12 and Pillow (Python
  Imaging Library Fork) 2.2.1 or newer to function.

  To use the library you need pysqlite (which is usually included in the
  standard library for Python 2.5 and later).

  You also need either the "unrar" or the "rar" program installed if you wish
  to read RAR (.cbr) archives.

  Alternatively, MComix can use libunrar from Rarlab. Place libunrar.so (or
  unrar.dll on Win32) either in the system's standard library path (/usr/lib
  or C:\Windows\system32), or directly in MComix' root directory when run
  without having first installed MComix.

  To read 7Zip archives, you need to have the "7z" program installed. Likewise,
  "lha" is needed to open LHA/LZA archives. Note that "7z" can be used as
  substitute for both "unrar" and "lha", but extraction of Unicode filenames
  on Windows will be broken in that case.

  To read PDF files, MComix can use the tools provided by MuPDF, namely
  mutool and mudraw.

=== Credits ===================================================================

  Thanks to everyone who have contributed translations, suggestions, bug
  reports, fixes and donations!

  Icons with a filename starting with "gimp" are taken from The GIMP, and
  icons with a filename starting with "tango" are taken from the Tango Desktop
  Project. Most other icons are made by Victor Castillejo, creator of the
  GNOME-Colors icon theme.
