MComix 1.2

    GUI/MAIN:

    - If metadata-based rotation is enabled, PNG files will be automatically
      rotated as well.

    - Double page mode respects Exif rotation now.

    - Some transformation issues have been fixed. In double page mode, all
      transformations are applied to the union of both pages. Also, reflection
      is performed first, followed by rotation.

    - Some OSD issues have been fixed.

    - When flipping pages, the content of the viewport does not appear
      somewhere else first anymore.

    - The default scaling quality is now "Bilinear".

    GUI/THUMBNAILER:

    - The thumbnailer now displays page numbers in a reasonable color
      appropriate for the respective background color.

    - The thumbnailer uses the same size for all thumbnails now. If thumbnails
      need to be rescaled, it is done using linear interpolation.

    - When using the keyboard, the thumbnailer now tries to keep the currently
      selected page in the upper half of its area.

    - The size of the thumbnailer is calculated more reasonably now.

    - Fixed a bug that could lead to crashes if the thumbnailer uses a dynamic
      background color.

    - The "missing image" icon appears in its original size in the thumbnailer.

    - Fix race condition that could lead to thumbnails being rendered with
      different sizes.

    - Added a workaround for a bug in gdk-pixbuf that could prevent thumbnails
      of animated GIF images from being rendered properly. For details, see
      https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=735422

    - Re-enabled double buffering for the thumbnailer.

    GUI/LIBRARY:

    - Some encoding issues with the library have been fixed.

    - The cover display in the library has been fixed.

    - The book area uses a tighter layout.

    - Various other issues with the library have been fixed.

    GUI/EDITARCHIVE:

    - Applying changes in the "Edit archive" dialog could raise an exception
      under certain circumstances. This has been fixed.

    - Fixed a bug that prevented MComix from shutting down properly if an
      archive with no images in it has been opened or the "Edit archive" dialog
      has been used.

    - Some issues with displaying thumbnails in the "Edit archive" dialog have
      been fixed.

    GUI/WM:

    - Fullscreen handling has been improved.

    - The Preferences dialog is not modal anymore.

    - When clicking on the thumbnailer while the main window is unfocused, the
      window should be focused only without switching to another page. This has
      been fixed so it works properly now.

    - Modal dialogs do not immediately hide the mouse cursor in the main area
      anymore.

    - Fix various minor window manager interaction issues.

    - The default window width is now 640 pixels.

    GUI/MISC:

    - You can select the text in the Properties dialog now.

    - The "Continue reading" dialog defaults to "Yes" now.

    - Dialogs refresh their respective contents whenever you switch to another
      page or book.

    - The password dialog now displays the path of the archive.

    - Overall widget handling has been fixed and improved. This also eliminates
      some GTK warnings.

    - Fixed a lot of issues with empty directories and empty archives.

    - File name filters and supported formats handling have been improved.

    - Various other issues with the Preferences dialog and the Properties
      dialog have been fixed.

    - Recently opened PDF files are now listed in the "Recent Files" menu.

    ENVIRONMENT/LOCALE/TRANSLATIONS:

    - The list of supported image formats is now determined dynamically,
      depending on the underlying libraries. This might implicitly add support
      for image formats such as WebP.

    - Due to a bug, PIL (or Pillow) was preferred over GdkPixbuf on Windows
      in earlier versions. Now, GdkPixbuf will be preferred on Windows as well.

    - MComix uses czipfile when available to speed up extraction of
      encrypted zip files.

    - Zombie processes will be removed if possible.

    - Some issues related to child processes have been fixed. Unnecessary
      console windows should not appear anymore.

    - File descriptors will be properly closed when possible. This fixes an
      issue especially on Windows where files used to stay "locked".

    - Searching for external tools (e.g. MuPDF) is performed more properly now.

    - Temporary directories will be created only when necessary and will be
      deleted as soon as the corresponding book has been closed.

    - The shebangs now ask for python2 instead of just python so we do not
      accidentally run Python 3.

    - comicthumb has been rewritten to make it consistent with MComix.

    - Some locale issues have been fixed.

    - The French translation has been updated.

    - The Russian translation has been updated (by Ulyanich Michael).

    - Fixed PDF support with newer versions of MuPDF (1.7 and 1.8).

    - Better support for using the 7z executable: encrypted files are now
      supported (including encrypted header support, and for all supported
      formats: 7z, RAR and ZIP).

    - Fixed an issue with unrar.dll that could lead to crashes if 7z is also
      present.

    - Improved detection of available RAR extractors. (unrar-free is currently
      incompatible with MComix and will be ignored.)

    - Fixed support for LHA archives (they were always marked as empty).

    - Updated libraries for the Windows distribution: Pillow 3.1.0 and
      UnRAR 5.30

    - On Windows, MComix normally appears to be frozen on startup while
      fontconfig is updating the font cache. As a workaround, a window will be
      displayed.

    - Fix MComix not starting when 'auto load last file' is on and the last
      attempt at opening a file was an invalid path

    - The Windows icon file mcomix.ico has been updated.

    MISC:

    - The MIME database has been updated.

    - The Py2Exe workaround has been removed.

    - A Wine-based helper script allows building Windows versions of MComix in
      Wine.

    - Huge code refactoring, cleanups and documentation updates

    - Various minor bug fixes and improvements

    - New code and examples for testing, improved logging

    - New version numbering scheme in compliance with PEP440

    - ChangeLog updated for MComix 1.01

MComix 1.01
Release date: 31.01.2015

    - Keyboard shortcuts can now be edited from MComix' preference dialog
      in a new tab "Shortcuts". (by Valentin Gologuzov)
      Please not that the arrow keys, Backspace and Escape cannot be bound
      to actions right now, unless you're manually editing the config file.

    - During database upgrade, MComix did not consider that books in the
      "Last read" database might no longer exist, leading to program crash.
      This has been fixed.

    - Adding a collection with a numeric name to the library made the library
      unusable. This has been fixed.

    - Fixed win32 builds missing the 'calendar' module.

    - Fixed bookmarks not being displayed in the Ubuntu Unity global menu.

    - Fixed 'Continue reading' not working when files are opened from
      the command line (by Boris Bogar).

    - Improved page extraction and caching algorithm, leading to much better
      responsiveness, especially for viewing large archives. (by Benoit Pierre)

    - MComix will now always hide the mouse cursor after a period of
      inactivity, even when not in fullscreen mode. (by Benoit Pierre)

    - The ALT+Left and ALT+Right keys will now either advance one page,
      or go back one page, depending on the user being in manga mode.

    - CTRL plus mouse wheel will now zoom in/out one level.

    - Manual zooming will now use a logarithmic scale instead of a linear
      spline.

    - The library will now use natural sorting for "Sort by name" and
      "Sort by path" instead of alphanumeric sorting, bringing it in line
      with most other sorting done by MComix.

    - Adding a book to a collection with the same book already existing
      in another collection did not immediately show the book in the
      library main view when the new collection was already selected.

    - MComix can now use the '7z' executable to read .tar.xz and .tar.lzma
      archives.

    - ZIP archives using BZIP2 compression will now fall back to external
      unzip/7z instead of failing (by Awad Mackie).

    - MComix can now read PDF files using tools provided by mupdf,
      namely mutool and mudraw. (by Benoit Pierre)

    - Double page mode will not implicitly resize images anymore.

    - The smart scrolling algorithm has been improved.

    - Some issues with the magnifying glass have been fixed.

    - Some new variables have been introduced that you can use when running
      external commands. See the documentation for details:
      https://sourceforge.net/p/mcomix/wiki/External_Commands

    - MComix will now use the current GTK theme's icons for
      Next/Previous buttons.

    - Added AppData meta information for software repositories.

    - Updated traditional Chinese translation (by Wayne Su).

MComix 1.00
Release date: 26.04.2013

    - When "Store information about recently opened files" is enabled in
      the preferences dialog, all opened books will automatically be added
      to the library and moved into the collection "Recent". In addition,
      the last read page will be stored and recalled the next time the book
      is opened again.

    - Fixed several malfunctions that could occur if no SQLite library
      was installed.

    - Fixed a bug that prevented MComix from showing the first page of an
      archive nested in other archives.

    - If both scrollbars were shown, it was impossible to scroll all the way
      down using the scrolling keys. This has been fixed.

    - When a directory was opened using the File->Open dialog, MComix did not
      sort files within the directory, ignoring the user's preferences.

    - "File->Refresh" did not restore the currently viewed page in archives.

    - Deleting a file in the library without closing the same file in the main
      window before no longer causes an exception.

    - The two images in double-page mode will now scale separately again.
      (by Valentin Gologuzov)

    - "Fit to size" mode no longer scales up small images unless "Stretch
      small images" is enabled as well.

    - If "Store information about recently opened files" is disabled,
      MComix will no longer remember the last browsed directory in the
      File->Open dialog.

    - Deleting a large amout of books from the library should be much
      faster now.

    - MComix now starts in RTL mode when a RTL language has been manually
      selected in the preference dialog.

    - Added an option to run arbitrary external commands on the currently
      opened file or archive. Commands can be edited from the "File->Open with"
      menu entry. The first item in this list can be accessed with the '1'
      key, the second using '2', and so on, up to '9' for command nine.

      The first argument to each command must be the absolute path to an
      executable, or an executable found in PATH, or an executable found in
      the specified working directory.

    - Added an option to automatically rotate images if their height exceeds
      their width (or width exceeds height), located in the menu bar under
      Tools -> Transform image -> Auto-rotate image.

    - Added a new preference option to control sorting of files within
      archives. Natural sort order is the default ordering, which sorts
      numbers in file names based on their natural order (e.g. 1, 2, .., 10),
      while literal order will use standard C sorting (e.g. 1, 23, 4).

    - "Reset zoom" is now bound to CTRL-0 and KeyPad0 by default. Previously,
      CTRL-0 and CTRL-KeyPad0 were used.

    - Using the Shift key with one of the next page / previous page
      keybindings will advance or go back by 10 pages instead of only one.

    - Added thumbnailer file for Gnome3 integration. Please note that
      comicthumb is unmaintained and not installed by MComix' setup routine
      by default.

    - MComix will no longer complain that the PIL library is missing when 
      a user has Pillow (a PIL fork) installed.

    - Updated traditional Chinese translation (by Wayne Su).

    - Updated Hebrew translation (by Isratine Citizen).

    - Updated Japanese translation (by Toshiharu Kudoh).

    - Updated Spanish translation (by Carlos Feliu).

    - Updated simplified Chinese translation (by Zach Cheung).

    - Updated French translation (by Frédéric Chateaux).

    - Updated Italian translation (by Giovanni Scafora).

MComix 0.99
Release date: 14.07.2012

    - Fixed "Go to page" dialog's thumbnail not scaling depending on dialog
      size.

    - Using the mouse wheel to scroll left now correctly advances to the
      next page in manga mode, instead of going back one page. Scrolling right
      has also been fixed.

    - Multiple open instances of MComix no longer overwrite each others'
      bookmarks when closed.

    - Fixed exception when trying to pack an archive using the archive editor.

    - Fixed a bug that prevented using the "Next archive"/"Previous archive"
      buttons when an empty archive was loaded (by Gabriel Falcone).

    - "Smart scrolling" now also works with the mouse wheel. In smart
      scrolling mode, MComix tries to follow the natural reading flow of a
      comic book by not only scrolling up or down, but also sideways.
      Please not that smart scrolling does not work in "Fit to width" or "Best
      fit mode", as there is no need to scroll sideways in these modes.

    - Zoom is now enabled in all fit modes (best fit, fit to width, fit to
      height).

    - Added new zoom mode 'Fit to size'. This mode always stretches an image
      to a given height or width. By default, a height of 1800px is set.
      This can be changed in the preferences dialog.

    - Most confirmation dialogs can now be permanently disabled by activating
      the "Do not ask again" checkbox in each dialog. This action can be
      undone by clicking on "Clear dialog choices" in the preferences dialog.

    - Added new preference option for switching between different resizing
      algorithms (higher quality usually means longer page loading times).

    - Added "Scan now" button to library watch list dialog to trigger
      immediate update. Also added an option to scan directories recursively.
      Automatically scanning for new books every time the library is opened
      can now be disabled in the watch list dialog.

    - The watch list feature no longer tries to add archive formats that
      aren't currently supported, i.e. no .7z archives when 7z isn't
      installed or found.

    - Added an option to quit the program when the ESC key is pressed. When
      disabled, ESC only exits fullscreen mode. ESC now also closes the
      library.

    - Added a new menu item to minimize the MComix window, bound to "N" by
      default.

    - Updated traditional Chinese translation (by Wayne Su).

    - Updated Italian translation (by Giovanni Scafora).

    - Added Hebrew translation (by Isratine Citizen).

MComix 0.98
Release date: 09.04.2012

    - Fixed a bug that occasionally caused MComix to display wrong images
      after deleting an image from a directory.

    - Fixed a bug that caused MComix to jump back up after scrolling down when
      an archive was still being loaded.

    - Fixed NumLock being enabled breaking other keybindings containing
      Shift, Alt or Ctrl (e.g. smart scrolling with space).

    - The last-read-page module now falls back to pysqlite2 if sqlite3 isn't
      available.

    - The library can now scan directories for new files every time it is
      started, and automatically add new books. Watched directories can be
      edited with the "Watch list" button in the library main window.

    - Added "Date added" to library sort criteriae. This might be slightly
      inaccurate for older library entries, as only the day, not the time of
      the moment a book was added used to be stored in the library database.

    - Improved performance for library book area and thumbnail side bar by
      only loading thumbnails when they become visible, e.g. triggered by the
      user scrolling around. The "Delay thumbnail generation" option has thus
      been removed.

    - Greatly improved performance for browsing directories with many images.

    - Updated Japanese translation (by Toshiharu Kudoh).

    - Updated French translation (by Frédéric Chateaux).

MComix 0.97.1
Release date: 18.02.2012

    - Corrected libunrar regression. (thanks to Giovanni Scafora for pointing
      this out)

MComix 0.97
Release date: 17.02.2012

    - Fixed segmentation fault on x64 platforms when trying to extract RAR
      archives with libunrar.

    - The lens now uses the original pixbuf when preparing the magnified image
      instead of the already scaled pixbuf that is shown in MComix' display
      area. In addition, fixed zero division error when trying to use the lens
      on images with width greatly exceeding height.

    - If 'Auto load last opened file' was enabled in the preferences, MComix
      would try to load an invalid path if no file was opened when MComix was
      last closed.

    - Menu item hotkeys can now be changed by hovering over a menu item with
      the mouse and pressing the desired key, or key combination.
      (by Juha Sahakangas and Alan Horkan)

    - All other hotkeys (such as keys for scrolling or zooming) can now be
      customized by editing keybindings.conf in MComix' configuration
      directory, i.e. ~/.config/mcomix on Linux or %HOMEPATH%/MComix on
      Windows. MComix must not be running while editing the file, or changes
      will be overwritten once the program exits.

    - Removed error nag box that would pop up after program shutdown on
      Windows occasionally.

    - The order in which files are loaded and displayed can now be customized
      in the "Advanced" tab of the preferences dialog. Files can be sorted
      either by name, file size, or by last-modified date. This change does
      not affect ordering of files inside archives.
      (by C Nelson)

    - MComix can now automatically remember the last read page in archive
      files. When an archive is opened, the last read page will be loaded if
      "Store information about recently opened files" is set to "File names
      and last read page" (see "Behaviour" tab of the preferences window).

    - Updated Italian translation (by Giovanni Scafora).

MComix 0.96
Release date: 24.12.2011

    - Opening a RAR archive with 7z would destroy the archive, leaving only
      a 0-byte file. This has been fixed.

    - Fixed MComix opening files in other directories after scrolling past the
      first page, even when "Automatically open next directory" was disabled.

    - Fixed a bug that would hang MComix when trying to open a
      password-protected RAR archive.

    - MComix no longer restores the last opened file when it was terminated
      abnormally.

    - Files opened outside of archives are now naturally sorted (e.g. 1.jpg,
      2.jpg, 10.jpg instead of 1.jpg, 10.jpg, 2.jpg). Before, only images
      within archives were naturally sorted.

    - The preference option "Show only one page where appropriate" has been
      split up to allow controlling whether certain pages should be displayed
      as single page in double page mode (title pages/wide pages/none).

    - "Delete" is now bound to "DEL" instead of "F8" for consistency with most
      other desktop applications.

    - Updated traditional Chinese translation (by Wayne Su).

MComix 0.95
Release date: 05.11.2011

    - mcomix/mcomixstarter.py has been moved out of the mcomix package into
      the root directory of the mcomix distribution.

      Note for packagers: Please do not directly symlink a file in /usr/bin to
      mcomix/run.py! Use the wrapper generated by 'setup.py install' instead,
      or a script similar to mcomixstarter.py.

    - Fixed library freezing up when displaying large amounts of books.
      In addition, changes to cover size and sort order weren't kept
      across program restarts.

    - Fixed "Copy to clipboard" doing nothing on Win32.

    - Fixed freezing on password-protected 7zip archives. Please not that such
      files currently aren't supported and will always appear empty in MComix.

    - The All-in-one package on Win32 should now use the native Windows theme.

    - Fix MComix crashing on startup when opening a file in a directory
      that contains names Python cannot directly convert to Unicode strings.
      (by Joseph Seaton)

    - Selecting "Japanese" from the language dropdown box in the preferences
      dialog reverted the language to English.

    - Added support for reading archives in archives.
      (by David Pineau)

    - Reduced minumum slideshow scrolling delay. With small values here and in
      scrolling distance (e.g. 0.05s, 1px), MComix can simulate "smooth"
      scrolling.

    - The "Dynamic background color" option now uses a color that should be
      closer to a page's actual edge color.

    - Removed preference options for 'Use double page mode by default' and
      'Use manga mode by default'. The last used settings will be remembered
      instead.

    - The OSD is now used more frequently for displaying error messages that
      would only appear in the status bar or in the console before.
      In addition, the OSD can now be triggered with mouse button 4, as well
      as with the TAB key.

    - Updated French translation. (by Frédéric Chateaux)

MComix 0.94
Release date: 27.09.2011

    - Fixed MComix opening archives in sibling directories
      even when "Automatically open next archive" was disabled.

    - Fixed recursively adding directories to the library not working
      consistently on Win32.

    - Fixed the first command line argument to MComix being ignored on Win32,
      breaking "Open with..." functionality.

    - The library window has been slighly reorganized. All collection-related
      functionality can now be accessed via the right-click popup on the
      collection panel to the left. Similiarily, "Add books" is now on the
      main book panel popup. Additionally, CTRL-SHIFT-A has been set as
      shortcut for this action.

    - Library covers will now be cached after being loaded. This will avoid
      frequent reloading when switching between collections, or when filtering
      books.

    - The magnifying lens can no longer become partially invisible when moving
      around near window edges, and should no longer flicker.

    - MComix automatically switching to next/previous directories can now
      be controlled with a new preference option.

    - Updated French translation. (by Frédéric Chateaux)

MComix 0.93
Release date: 27.08.2011

    - Removing a book from the library while its thumbnail wasn't loaded yet
      would result in a segmentation fault. This issue has been fixed.

    - Fixed sorting in the bookmark edit dialog not working as expected. The
      buttons "Sort ascending" and "Sort descending" have been removed, as
      they did the same as clicking on the "Name" header of the bookmarks
      table. Double-clicking a bookmark will open it.

    - Fixed a bug that made it impossible to show toolbar/menu controls in
      fullscreen mode if "Automatically hide all toolbars in fullscreen" was
      enabled.

    - Fixed exception related to calculation of dynamic background colors.
      (by Nephiel)

    - Library collection names did not accept non-ASCII characters. This has
      been fixed.

    - Added support for LHA/LZH archives, using either 'lha' or '7z' as
      extractors. Please not that the '7z' executable on Windows does not
      support printing Unicode characters at all, so extracting an archive with
      non-ASCII filenames will always fail.

    - By selecting a folder instead of a file in the library's "Add book"
      dialog, all archives within the selected directory will be added to the
      library recursively.

    - Doing the same in the normal "Open" dialog will open all files within the
      directory.

    - MComix will now ask for confirmation when creating a new bookmark in an
      archive that was already bookmarked before. This allows the user to
      either create a new bookmark, or replace the old one with the current
      page.

    - ALT+Left mouse button and ALT+Right now advance one page, while ALT+Right
      mouse button/ALT+Left go back one page.

    - When on the last page, advancing to the next page will load files from
      the next sibling directory - holding CTRL is no longer necessary.

    - Added a new option to invert the smart scrolling direction. Instead of
      going left/right, then top/bottom, MComix will scroll top/bottom, then
      left/right.

    - Settings in the Enhance dialog can now be remembered using the "Save"
      button.

    - The option "Stretch small images" now increases an image's base size
      when using manual zoom mode.

    - Information shown in the status bar can now be enabled/disabled
      separately by right-clicking on the status bar and toggling the
      respective check box.

    - By pressing TAB, an OSD-like panel will be displayed, showing the current
      page and file.

    - MComix can now use Chardet (http://chardet.feedparser.org) for guessing
      filename encodings in archives, if installed. If file names are too
      short, the detection will still be hit-and-miss.

MComix 0.92
Release date: 27.05.2011

    - Fixed a bug that made MComix save preview thumbnails to disk
      even if this behaviour was disabled in the preferences window.

    - Fixed a bug in the the archive editor that prevented it from actually
      saving the modified archive on Win32.

    - Added limited support for password-protected ZIP and RAR archives.
      For ZIP archives, Python >= 2.6 is required. For RAR archives,
      only extraction with libunrar/unrar.dll is supported.

    - Added a combobox to the library dialog to enable sorting of books
      based on file name, full path, or file size.

    - If a library collection has sub-collections, the books from these
      sub-collections will be shown as well when the collection is opened.

    - The "Bookmarks" menu can be accessed via the normal menu bar again.
      "Clear bookmarks" has been removed in favour of using the "Edit
      bookmarks" dialog.
      (by Alan Horkan)

    - Several usability improvements were done to the Enhance, Edit and
      Library dialogs.

    - If applications for extracting RAR or 7Z archives aren't found on
      start-up, MComix will no longer allow selecting the corresponding file
      types in the "Open" dialog.
      (suggested by Alan Horkan)

    - The "Copy" menu item will now copy the current file name to the
      clipboard, in addition to the currently opened page as bitmap.

    - The currently opened file or archive can now be deleted using
      File -> Delete, or by pressing F8.

    - Added an option to use the first page of an archive as application
      icon instead of the standard MComix icon. (inspired by Alexandr
      Domrachev)

    - Added an option to manually change the user interface language
      used by MComix. Changes to the language require an application
      restart to take effect.

    - Added the following new command line switches:
      -m                  Manga mode
      -s                  Slideshow
      -d                  Double-page mode
      -b, -w, -h          Fit best/width/height, respectively.
      (suggested by Anonymous on the Comix tracker, adapted by Alan Horkan)
      -W[all|warn|error]  Set log level (default is 'warn')

    - The following preference items have been removed: 
      "Automated crash recovery": No longer necessary.
      "Show page numbers": Enabled by default.
      "Avoid unintentional page flips": Enabled by default.
      "Stretch small images": Now in Menu->View->Stretch small images.
      "Default zoom mode": Last setting is remembered instead.

MComix 0.91
Release date: 24.04.2011

    - Fixed excessive memory consumption due to cached pixmaps not being
      properly evicted.

    - Fixed certain wait conditions that prevented MComix from exiting
      on Win32.

    - Fixed "Remove from the library" deleting the actual book instead of
      its library thumbnail.

    - The "Go to page" dialog now shows thumbnails when they are available, 
      not only after all thumbnails have been loaded. Additionally,
      some usability improvements have been done to the dialog, such as
      instantly updating the thumbnail when editing the page box, and setting
      focus to the page box when the dialog is opened.

    - When passing more than one file to MComix at startup, only those files
      will be opened. This differs from the traditional behavior, where
      MComix would only consider the first file and open all remaining
      files in the same directory.
      If the passed files are archives, MComix will only open these archives
      when "Automatically open next archive" is enabled. If only a single file
      is passed, MComix will keep opening all files in that directory.

    - When the first/last file of a directory is open, pressing CTRL and
      advancing to the previous/next page (e.g. by pressing CTRL+Space),
      files in the previous/next sibling directory will be opened.
      Note that this feature is disabled by intent when MComix has been
      opened with a list of more than one file.

      This feature is also available via CTRL+N/CTRL+P, or the menu bar.

    - Speed up thumbnail generation by parallelizing load tasks.
      (inspired by David Zaragoza, who originally suggested to use
      processes instead of threads)

    - Library cover generation is now parallelized as well.

    - New option to delay loading of thumbnails. This way, thumbnails will
      only be generated when they are actually needed, i.e. the thumbnail
      sidebar is open or "Go to page" is used.

    - Minor options have been moved into a new tab in the preferences dialog.

    - MComix' configuration files are now stored in ~/.config/mcomix instead
      of in ~/.local/share/mcomix, as originally intended.

    - Added the toolbar show/hide menu to the right-click popup. Previously,
      if the menu bar had been disabled using the normal menu, there was no
      way to get it back.

    - The menu bar can now also be shown/hidden using CTRL+M.
      (by Alan Horkan)

    - MComix could not switch back to windowed mode when started in fullscreen
      mode on Win32.

    - The MComix window will no longer close instantly after starting up when
      reporting an error due to unsatisfied dependencies on Win32.

    - Fixed the settings dialog window no longer opening when it has been
      closed with the X icon on the dialog before.

    - Fix "Automatically open next archive" with empty archives.

    - Fixed magnifiying lens being broken when the page was rotated in any
      way.

    - Fixed setup.py failing when no X session was started.

    - Required Python version is now 2.5 or newer.

    - Updated Swedish translation. (by Martin Karlsson)

    - Updated Russian translation. (by Евгений Лежнин)

MComix 0.90.3
Release date: 13.03.2011

    - MComix now uses a slightly different directory structure than before. 
      The 'src' folder is now 'mcomix' to provide a correct package name.
      'mcomix.py' is now 'mcomixstarter.py' to avoid confusing Python by
      having a module with the same name as the package around.
      Translations and images required by the GUI are now sub-packages of
      'mcomix'. 

      A setuptools-based setup.py replaces install.py. This should help for
      uniform installs across different operating systems.

    - Several strings have been reworked to ease localization.

    - Added ability to apply current changes in the edit archive window.

    - Various usability fixes on Win32, including Unicode filenames,
      loading speed, recently opened files not being displayed,
      temporary directories not being deleted, crashing due to missing
      icons, MIME type file filters in the "Open" dialog not working,
      thumbnails being regenerated unnecessarily, and others.

    - Magnifying lens is now hotkeyed to 'L', while 'G' is Go to page. (by
      Nephiel)

    - Right-click menu is now more suitable for fullscreen reading, adding
      several menu items previously only available via normal menu. (by
      Nephiel)

    - Additional RAR handler using libunrar.so/unrar.dll.

      Added archive handler using Rarlab's libunrar library
      for extracting files. Apart from being faster for sequential
      extractions than calling unrar for each single file,
      this library supports Unicode filenames natively and thus
      allows Windows users to read most RAR files.
      Libunrar can be obtained from http://www.rarlab.com/rar_add.htm
      and can be placed either in usual system directories such as
      /usr/lib or C:\Windows\system32, or directly in MComix' root directory.

    - Fixed rar/unrar failing regularly on Win32 when the archive contains
      files not matching the current locale.

    - Go to Page is now enabled even when the archive is still loading. (by
      Nephiel)

    - Added support for the 7zip archive format. As with rar/unrar, this
      requires the "7z" executable being installed and on PATH.

    - When pressing CTRL while being in double page mode, stepping forwards
      and backwards will now always only advance/go back one image instead of
      possibly two. 

    - Graceful shutdown on SIGTERM. (by Marco Nicolini)

    - Switching pages while in slideshow mode now resets the slideshow timer.
      (by Anonymous)

    - When opening an archive in double page mode, the first page (i.e. the
      cover) is displayed as single page.

    - The currently opened file can now be extracted from archives using
      the 'Save as...' menu item.

    - Fixed thumbnail size preference not being respected, and scaling of
      book covers in the library dialog being broken.

    - Files in the library can now be opened without closing the library
      window using the right-click popup menu.

    - Reordered various menu items.

    - A possible deadlock that could occur when opening archive files has been
      fixed.

    - Updated German translation.

    - Added page selector with page preview.

    - Added preference regarding the number of keys pressed needed to flip the page.

    - Added next archive and previous archive buttons.

    - Added copy (CTRL+C) functionality which allows copying of the current image.

    - Added thumbnail cacheing and threading.

    - Added threaded page cacheing and cacheing preferences.
    
    - Added the preference to turn on/off page number display.
    
Comix is forked and becomes MComix

    - Added a Ukrainian translation by Олександр Заяц.
    
    - Added a Galician translation by Roxerio Roxo Carrillo.
    
    - The German translation updated for Comix 4 by Chris Leick.
    
    - Added support for BMP images in archives. Thanks to Nathaniel Moseley.
    
    - The status bar now displays the filename of the viewed image files also
    in archives.
    
    - Fixed a bug that caused the wrong background colour to be used with the
    dynamic background colour preference on some systems. Thanks to Nathaniel
    Moseley.
    
    - Fixed a bug that could cause the thumbnail maintenance dialog to crash.
    
    - Fixed a bug that caused the zoom scale in manual zoom mode to be wrong
    when using double page mode.


Comix 4.0.4
    
    - Applied a workaround for a bug that caused the "Open" dialog to crash
    when trying to open a file when the file type filter had been reset to
    blank. This bug seems to only appear on some systems, probably depending
    on the installed GTK+ version.
    
    - Fixed a bug that caused the error message for unfulfilled dependencies
    to not be printed properly.
    
    - The rar/unrar program is now invoked in such a way as to keep broken
    or incomplete files extracted from RAR archives, since Comix might be
    able to display parts of these files anyway.

Comix 4.0.3
    
    - Hungarian translation updated by Ernő Drabik.
    
    - French translation updated by Benoît H.
    
    - Added a feature to automatically rotate images according to their

    when set as the default mode.
    
    - Comix now accepts directories as command-line arguments.
    
    - Added command-line arguments to start Comix in fullscreen mode and to
    display the library on startup.
    
    - Comix preferences and data now reside in the $XDG_CONFIG_HOME and
    $XDG_DATA_HOME directories instead of in ~/.comix/.
    
    - Some minor interface enhancements.

Comix 4.0.2

    - Brazilian Portuguese translation updated by Marcelo Góes.
    
    - Traditional Chinese translation updated by Wayne Su.
    
    - Catalan translation updated by Carles Escrig Royo.
    
    - Internal filenames in archives created by the archive editing dialog
    no longer contain temporary filename cruft.

Comix 4.0.1

    - Croatian translation updated by Adrian C.
    
    - Polish translation updated by Darek Jakoniuk.
    
    - Russian translation updated by Артем Смирнов.
    
    - Simplified Chinese translation updated by Xie Yanbo.
    
    - Re-added the "flip pages when scrolling off the page" preference
    from previous Comix versions. Thanks to Mamoru Tasaka.
    
    - Added a portability module for handling home directories in a more 
    portable way. Thanks to Oddegamra. 

Comix 4.0.0
    
    - Comix has been completely rewritten from scratch. On the surface things
    look quite a bit like they used to, but the internal workings are 
    entirely new. There are too many changes for them all to be mentioned
    here, but a couple of highlights are a much more functional library and a
    new archive editing dialog. The work on this new version of Comix has
    been going on in rather sporadic phases for almost two years, and during
    that time I have received help from lots of different people. Now, I must
    admit, I can no longer remember them all. So instead of trying to list as
    many as I can here, I will instead simply say thank you to everyone who
    have contributed fixes, patches, suggestions or encouraging words. Thanks!

Comix 3.6.5
    
    - Applied security fix patches to handle unsecure tempfile creation and
    character escaping in filenames. Thanks to Mamoru Tasaka and others for
    the patches.
    
    - Added a Korean translation by 김민기.
    
    - Added a Persian translation by Maryam Sanaat.
    
    - Added a Indonesian translation by Andhika Padmawan.
    
    - Added a Czech translation by Jan Nekvasil.

Comix 3.6.4
    
    - Added a Russian translation by Artyom Smirnov.
    
    - Added a Croatian translation by Adrian C.
    	
    - Fixed a bug in the thumbnailer, comicthumb, failing to create thumbnails
    for Zip and tar archives.
    	    
    - Some minor changes.


Comix 3.6.3
    
    - Added a Hungarian translation by Ernő Drabik.
    
    - Added a patch by Abdullah Hamed that fixes so that the arrow keys can be
    used to flip pages also when not in fit-to-screen mode when the
    corresponding preference is set. Just like was possible only with the
    scroll wheel before.
    
    - Fixed a bug with opening certain Zip files. Thanks to Steve Juranich for
    the fix.
    
    - Fixed a bug concerning %'s in filenames.

Comix 3.6.2
    
    - Added Japanese translation by Mamoru Tasaka.

Comix 3.6.1

    - Updated Brazilian Portuguese and Dutch translations.

Comix 3.6

    - Added an "Adjust colour" dialog that lets you specify values for
    brightness, contrast, saturation and sharpness.
    
    - Improved the behaviour of the "Save window position and size" and
    "Default fullscreen" preferences.
    
    - Changed the "Save window position and size" preference to on by default.
    
    - Changed the menus a bit.
    
    - Improved autocontrast (slightly heavier contrast change).
    
    - Changed the UI of the properties dialog a bit to better suit low
    resolution screens.
    
    - Improved handling of Zip files containing files with filenames of an 
    unknown character encoding.
    
    - Added extra error message to install.py that is displayed when trying to
    install into a non-existing directory.
    
    - Added a --no-balloon option to install.py that tells the Nautilus 
    thumbnailer to not imprint balloon images on thumbnails by default.
    
    - Fixed a bug that could cause Comix to scale images to the wrong 
    dimensions on a dual-screen setup. Thanks to Vegard Eriksen for this fix.
    
    - Fixed a bug that caused icons to not be loaded when starting Comix
    through a symbolic link not located in the same directory as the `comix`
    executable.
    
    - Fixed a bug that could cause an error message when going back to a
    previous archive by flipping backwards in double page mode and directly
    switching to single page mode afterwards.
    
    - Fixed a bug that caused Comix to treat empty files as tar archives.
    Thanks to Christoph Wolk for this fix.

    - Fixed a bug in comicthumb with thumbnailing rar archives, plus
    some cleanup. (Christoph Wolk)

Comix 3.5.1

    - Fixed a bug that caused the mode of all images to be reported as
    "unknown" instead of RGB/CMYK etc.
    
    - Fixed a bug that could cause an error when trying to quit Comix under
    certain circumstances (i.e. when there is no ~/.comix/menu_thumbnails/
    directory present).

Comix 3.5

    - Added a bunch of new icons, including a new "logo".
    
    - The magnifying lens code has been polished a bit. It is now
    substantially faster so the lens should appear less choppy.
    
    - Added horizontal and vertical lossless JPEG flip commands.
    
    - Added a JPEG desaturation command.
    
    - Added support for SVG, PCX, PNM, PBM, PGM, PPM, Targa and Sun raster
    image files.
    
    - Rearranged the toolbar a bit and added tooltips to it.
    
    - When a directory is given as a command line parameter, Comix now
    recursively searches for cbr, cbz and cbt files as well as image files.
    
    - Changed install.py so that it aborts installation if the required
    dependencies are not found.
    
    - Fixed a bug that caused the space key to not scroll down when in double
    page mode and manga mode and the window is wider than the pages.
    
    - Applied a workaround for a bug(?) in WindowMaker that caused problems
    when using the "fullscreen as default" preference.
    
    - Fixed a memory leak in the magnifying lens code.
    
    - Some internal and some minor changes.

Comix 3.4

    - Added more image data to the properties dialog.
    
    - Added a "delete image" command that can remove single images from Comix.
    It is currently not possible to remove image files within archives.
    
    - Added lossless JPEG rotation commands. It is currently not possible to
    rotate image files within archives. The `jpegtran` program (part of the 
    jpeg library) must be present for this to work. Comix can still run as
    normal without `jpegtran`, but then without the new JPEG rotation
    capabilities.
    
    - Changed the buttons in the toolbar.
    
    - Improved the space key smart scrolling mode so that it automatically
    performs all the sideways scrolling as well.
    
    - Added a preference to set the magnitude of the space key scroll in
    percentages of either the window size or the page size.
    
    - Added a Traditional Chinese translation by Hsin-Lin Cheng.
    
    - Comments are now displayed using a monospaced font.
    
    - Comments can now be dragged around with the mouse just like an image.
    
    - Directories can now be given as command line parameters as well as
    files. If a directory is given it will be recursed into and the first
    image file found will be loaded.
    
    - Improved cover guessing of comicthumb and the library a bit.
    
    - Handling of files that have filenames encoded with the wrong
     character encoding is now more sturdy.
     
     - Fixed a bug that could cause outdated thumbnails to be left in the
     ~/.comix/menu_thumbnails/ directory when running multiple instances of
     Comix at the same time.
     
     - Applied a workaround for a bug(?) in WindowMaker that caused the "Open
     dialog" to be invisible while in fullscreen mode when using WindowMaker.
     The same problem applies to the library window, but there is no
     workaround for that in place currently.
     
     - Fixed a bug that could cause no images to be displayed when turning
     double page mode off, then on again and flipping to the next couple
     of pages in that order.
     
    - Some minor changes.

Comix 3.3

    - Added a slideshow feature.
    	
    - Added RGB colour histogram to the properties dialog. More data will be
    added in future versions.
    
    - Added a Catalan translation by Carles Escrig.		
    
    - Rewrote install.py from scratch.
    
    - Fixed a bug that caused compressed tar archives to be presented as
    plain tar archives.
    
    - Fixed a bug that could cause invalid page numbers in bookmarks when
    re-adding an already present bookmark.
    
    - Some minor changes.

Comix 3.2.1

    - Added support for the `rar` program in addition to `unrar` to handle 
    RAR (.cbr) files.
    
    - Updated Polish translation by Kamil Leduchowski.
    
    - Some minor changes.

Comix 3.2

    - Changed PyGTK requirement to version 2.8 or higher.
    
    - Added a "Fit width mode" and a "Fit height mode" that automatically
    scales images to fit the width or height of the window.
    
    - Default filenames for extracted images are changed to 
    <archive_name>_<page>.<ext> from <page>.<ext>.
    
    - Moved the manga mode setting from the preferences dialog to the menus.
    
    - Redesigned the library interface a bit. The background colour is now
    fixed and does not change with the background colour of the main window.
    Default thumbnail size is now 128x128 px, and thumbnails have a border to
    make them more clearly separated. 
    
    - Added Greek translation by Paul Chatzidimitriou.
    
    - Xie Yanbo updated the Simplified Chinese translation.
    
    - Changed the menu icons for "Open library..." and "Add to library". The 
    icons are taken from the Silk Icons set at www.famfamfam.com.
    
    - Broken images are now correctly handled by the thumbnail sidebar.
    
    - The workaround against a problem with unrar applied in version 3.1.3 has
    been removed again. It created some new problems with archives that
    have multiple files with the same filename in different subdirectories.
    
    - Fixed a bug so that translations and extra icons are always available
    when running Comix from the source directory, no matter what directory is 
    the current working directory.
    
    - Fixed a bug in the "Go to page dialog" that caused the page to not be
    changed when manually typing in a new page number and pressing Enter.
    
    - Some minor changes.

Comix 3.1.3

    - Added Polish translation by Kamil Leduchowski.
    
    - Updated French translation by Achraf Cherti.

Comix 3.1.2

    - Fixed a bug which caused ALL files to be added to the library when 
    adding in recursive mode instead of just archives. Also, only files with
    cbz, cbr or cbt as filename extension will now be added in recursive mode
    to avoid adding cruft files with the same magic numbers as the archives.

Comix 3.1.1

    - Added automatic dependency checking to install.py.
    
    - Added error messages and graceful exit from Comix in the case of missing
    dependencies.
    
    - Applied a workaround for a bug(?) in unrar that caused problems with
    some RAR archives containing directories with invalid filename encodings.
    Thanks to François Ingelrest.
    
    - Updated French translation by Achraf Cherti.
    
    - Changed the "Use stored thumbnails for images in archives" preference to
    off by default.
    
    - Changed the "Go to the next archive in directory after last page"
    preference to on by default.

Comix 3.1

    - Created a new convert dialog that is built from the standard GTK+ save
    dialog. It now supports saving in different directories etc.
    
    - Added an "Extract image" menu item that lets you extract individual
    images from the archive.
    
    - Added support for recursive adding of archives to the library.
    
    - Added a Frech translation by Achraf Cherti.
    
    - Fixed a bug which rendered the magnifying lens and the ability to drag
    images around with the mouse useless in some situations, and with some
    certain versions (7.0?) of X.org.
    
    - Pressing enter in the "Go to page" dialog entry now has the same effect
    as pressing OK.
    
    - Applied a workaround for a bug(?) in certain builds of PIL that made
    Comix crash when it tried to draw page numbers on thumbnails. Now Comix
    simply ignores the page numbers if this problem occurs and imforms the
    user that a different version of PIL is required, instead of crashing.

Comix 3.0.1

    - Added a Dutch translation by Arthur Nieuwland.

Comix 3.0

    - Major cleanup of the entire code base.
    
    - Completely redesigned the properties dialog.
    
    - Comix now stores a list of the 10 last viewed files. It also updates the
    ~/.recently-used file as is proposed by the freedesktop.org standard.
    Thanks to Jose M. daLuz.
    
    - Added an "Add to library" menu item.
    
    - Redesigned the library window slightly.
    
    - Added an Italian translation by Raimondo Giammanco.
    
    - The Nautilus thumbnailer, comicthumb, has been updated by Christoph Wolk
    to support subarchives among other things.
    
    - Added a preference to set the size of the magnifying lens. Thanks to 
    Jose M. daLuz.
    
    - Added a scalable svg icon.
    
    - Improved handling of files without read permission. 
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused the recommended name for a converted directory
    of images to be the same as one of the image files plus filename extension
    instead of the name of the directory plus filename extension. Thanks to 
    Manuel Quiñones.
    
    - Fixed a bug with the magnifying lens which could appear when using it in
    double page mode and manga mode, possibly showing the images as if not in
    manga mode.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused unnecessary reloading of files from disk when
    resizing images that is already in memory in double page mode.
    
    - Fixed a bug which could cause the wrong image to be displayed when 
    continuously flipping forward really fast in cache mode.
    
    - Some minor fixes.

Comix 2.9

    - Added a comic book library feature to Comix. Comic book archives can be
    added to the library through a dialog or by drag and drop. The comic books
    appear as covers in the library window where they can be browsed or
    opened. They can be easily filtered by typing in regular expressions.
    
    - When dropping multiple files on the Comix main window, the first file
    gets opened now instead of none.
    
    - The convert dialog now saves the last used archive type. 
    
    - Fixed a memory leak when creating new thumbnails from files.
    
    - Some minor fixes.

Comix 2.8

    - MIME types for cbz, cbr and cbt archives are now registered by default.
    Use the --no-mime flag for install.py to skip it.
    
    - Added a thumbnailer (by Christoph Wolk) that lets file managers create
    thumbnails for cbz, cbr and cbt archives. Currently it is only supported
    by Nautilus and does not affect other file managers. It is installed if
    the --no-mime flag is not given to install.py. Nautilus has to be
    restarted before the thumbnailer is activated.
    
    - Added a "Hide all" menu item which hides menubar, toolbar, statusbar, 
    scrollbars and thumbnails at once.
    
    - Added an option to only display a single image in double page mode if
    that image consists of two pages. An image is assumed to consist of two
    pages if it's width is greater than it's height.
    
    - Filename is now displayed as well as directory name when viewing images
    in a directory in single page mode.
    
    - Changed max zoom to 1000% to prevent X server resource drains.
    
    - F11 can now be used to toggle fullscreen mode.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused the cursor to be invisible when dragging around
    an image in fullscreen mode.
    
    - Fixed a bug which removed the drag and drop functionality.
    
    - Fixed a bug which could cause the scroll wheel to stop working when
    displaying the magnifying lens by pressing the middle mouse button,
    holding down the right mouse button and letting go the middle mouse button
    again.
    
    - Fixed a bug which could cause the chess board pattern background for
    small transparent images to be zoomed in or out when changing size.
    
    - Fixed a bug which could cause changes of saturation in small images to
    not be updated when changing it and changing it back again.
    
    - Fixed a bug which could cause the images to be scaled incorrectly when
    the "Use smart scaling in double page mode" preference was set.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused the thumb selection not to be updated when
    moving from page two to page one in double page mode.
    
    - Some minor fixes.

Comix 2.7

    - Improved image quality through dithering in 16 bits per pixel. Thanks to
    John Ellis, the author of GQview, for helping me with this.
    
    - Added previews of files in the "Open" dialog. Stored thumbnails are used
    when they exist, otherwise previews are created directly from the files.
    Previews of archives are also available, but only when thumbnails have
    already been stored for that archive.
    
    - The cursor is now only being hidden when it has been idle for two
    seconds instead of always.
    
    - Changed "Hide cursor in fullscreen mode" to on by default.
    
    - Added chess board pattern as background for transparent images.
    
    - Added file filters to the "Open" dialog.
    
    - Saturation adjustment now affects the magnifying lens also.
    
    - Added Brazilian Portuguese translation by Marcelo Góes.
    
    - Added German translation by Christoph Wolk.
    
    - Added a "comix.xml" file which can be installed to register cbz, cbr and
    cbt mime types. Because of inconsistency on some systems, mime types are
    not registered by default. Follow the instructions in the mime README file
    to install. Thanks to Cristoph Wolk for this contribution.
    
    - Changed permissions of temporary folders to octal 700 to preserve the
    users privacy.
    
    - Added page number information to thumbnails generated for archives. This
    information will displayed for previews of archives if available.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused the image width and height information embedded
    in thumbnails to be put in the wrong namespace of the PNG tEXt chunks.
    
    - Fixed possible wrong permissions of thumbnail folders on some systems.
    Permissions should now always be 700.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused the magnifying lens to display the wrong page
    in manga mode (thanks Christoph Wolk).
    
    - Fixed a bug which could cause Comix to crash when trying to view a very
    small image scaled down so that it contained no pixels at all.
    
    - Some minor fixes.

Comix 2.6

    - Comix now conforms to the thumbnail managing standard as proposed by
    freedesktop.org. Thumbnails for plain image files can be read and written
    to ~/.thumbnails where they are shared with other applications conforming
    to the same standard. Thumbnails for images in archives can also be
    stored, but due to limitations in the standard they are stored in ~/.comix
    for private use by Comix only.
    
    - Improved handling of corrupt and missing files. Comix now simply
    displays a "file missing" image instead of terminating.
    
    - Added a menu entry for the lens toggle action.
    
    - Some minor fixes.

Comix 2.5

    - Added a mouse controlled "magnification lens" that can be used to zoom
    in on parts of the images. It will appear while holding the middle mouse
    button. Pressing 'z' can also toggle it on or off.
    
    - Added the ability to set the size of the thumbnails.
    
    - Improved the look of the bookmark handling features. Small thumbnails
    will now be displayed for the bookmarks.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused one of the two images in double page mode to
    remain displayed even after using the "Close" command.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused the "Use smart scaling in double page mode"
    preference to misbehave with rotated images.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused the convert dialog to not automatically fill in
    a new filename for files with non-UTF8 filenames.
    
    - Some minor fixes.

Comix 2.4.1

    - Improved cache handling slightly.
    
    - FIxed a bug which could cause Comix to crash when starting with the
    "Save window position and size for future sessions" option turned on.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused only one thumbnail to remain selected when 
    clicking on the first of the two selected thumbnails in double page mode.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused Comix to always go to the first page when
    reloading thumbnails in double page mode due to switching the "Show page
    numbers on thumbnails" on or off.

Comix 2.4

    - Added full support for internationalization (i18n). Apart from English,
    Comix is now translated to Swedish, Simplified Chinese and Spanish.
    
    - Added an option to let Comix automatically adjust the contrast of the
    images so that the darkest pixel is completely black and the lightest
    pixel is completely white.
    
    - Added an option to space key "smart scrolling" feature as if in double
    page mode even when in single page mode.
    
    - Added thin borders around the thumbnails so that they should be more 
    easily distinguished.
    
    - Added accelerators for more menu items.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused the wrong image to be displayed when viewing
    the third last and the second last pages in double page mode, exiting
    double page mode and flipping forward one page.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused Comix to display no warning when trying to
    create a file in a directory where it does not have permission to do so.

Comix 2.3

    - Comix now depends on the Python Imaging Library 
    (http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/) to handle some image 
    manipulations.
    
    - Added the ability to rotate and mirror images.
    
    - Added an option to set the contrast of the images.
    
    - Added an option to show the page numbers in the upper left corner of
    each thumbnail.
    
    - Cleaned up the preferences dialog a bit.
    
    - The arrow keys now flips pages in fit-to-screen mode.
    
    - Added an option to go to the same directory as last time when opening
    the "Open" dialog, instead of always going to a preset directory.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused comments to not be displayed until after all
    thumbnails had been loaded when using the "Always view comments when
    opening a new file" option.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused comment files in a directory, had their 
    extensions been added to the comment extensions list while the directory
    was loaded, to not be opened correctly until the directory had been
    reloaded.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused the scrollbars to not align themselves 
    automatically when switching between viewing comments and viewing images.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused the "Fit width", "Fit height" and "Best fit"
    commands to scale incorrectly when viewing thumbnails.
    
    - Fixed a bug which could cause the wrong image to be displayed if
    switching from one page to another and back again really quickly.
    
    - Some minor fixes.

Comix 2.2.1

    - Fixed a bug which caused underscores in bookmark names to be shown 
    as underlines for the next character.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused Comix to crash when trying to close the 
    program while loading thumbnails for an archive/directory that was 
    opened while loading thumbnails for the same archive/directory.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused some events (e.g. switching fullscreen on/off),
    invoked while loading thumbnails, to be delayed until all the thumbnails
    had been loaded if they were invoked more than once during this loading.
    There are still some issues with events that in themself initiate the
    loading of thumbnails (e.g. open new file) being delayed if invoked
    multiple times during the loading. This should, however, not be a problem
    in most cases.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused some thumbnails to not be displayed in whole
    when using certain GTK themes.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused the selected thumbnails to not be updated
    properly when switching between single page and double page mode.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused the thumbnail scrollbar to not update it's
    length when resizing the main window.
    
    - Made the automatic scrolling of the thumbnail pane more consequent
    in double page mode.

Comix 2.2

    - Added a thumbnail browser.
    
    - Added a "smart scrolling" option for the space key. 
    
    - The number pad on the keyboard can now be used to align the image(s). 
    '1' takes you to the lower left corner, '2' takes you to the middle of the
    bottom, '3' takes you to the lower right corner and so on for all nine
    digits.
    
    - Added an option to automatically open the last viewed page when Comix
    is started.
    
    - The zoom in and zoom out commands now zoom straight on, preserving
    the alignment of the viewed image(s).
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused images to be scaled slighty wrong during
    specific window size/image size combinations.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused the wrong image to be displayed when jumping
    two pages forward with the cache option turned on in single page mode.

Comix 2.1

    - Made the dialogs more GNOME HIG compliant.
    
    - Added an option to let the scroll wheel scroll horizontally when at the 
    top or bottom of the page.
    
    - Added an option to let the scroll wheel flip pages when scrolling "off 
    the page".
    
    - Added an option to use smart scaling when in double page mode and
    fit-to-screen mode. The smart scaling feature makes the images scale
    independently so that no space is wasted. The largest of the images is 
    scaled as before, but the smallest in now scaled up to fill any extra
    space.
    
    - Added an option to set the toolbar to show either icons, text or both.
    
    - The image can now be dragged around with the middle mouse button
    as well.
    
    - If adding a bookmark for an archive/directory that is already 
    bookmarked, Comix now updates the page number of that bookmark
    instead of adding a new one.
    
    - Added tooltips for the preferences dialog.
    
    - Removed the zoom entry in the preferences dialog.
    
    - Made the cleanup of files in /tmp a bit more sturdy.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused the scrollbars to not align themselves 
    automatically when opening a new archive/folder.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused changes to fullscreen, fit-to-screen mode etc. 
    that were made while the preferences dialog was open to be reverted when 
    the dialog was closed.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused some images to appear twice if they were 
    packed in an archive containing multiple subfolders.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused some strange behaviour when (un)hiding the
    menubar after a bookmark had been added/removed.
    
    - Some minor fixes.

Comix 2.0

    - The text in the comments is now selectable.
    
    - Some minor (mainly cosmetic) changes.

Comix 2.0b

    - Comix 2.0b has a major speed advantage over previous versions.
    I rewrote some of the code, mainly the parts concerning the caching of 
    images. Page flipping with the cache option turned off is now about 
    twice as fast as before (not counting the time it takes to scale the 
    image(s) since this is highly dependant on the image scaling quality being 
    used). Forward page flipping with the cache option turned on now seems
    almost instantaneous (again not counting the possible delay to scale 
    the image(s)). Backwards flipping with the cache option turned on is no 
    longer suffering any speed penalty, it is just as fast as normal flipping
    without any cache would be. The only occasion when things will be slower
    with the cache option turned on is when doing irregular flipping, as from 
    page 1 to page 7 to page 3 etc., and even then things will seem to be 
    as fast as normal though some extra work is done "under the hood". 
    Using cache is strongly recommended from now on.
    
    - Added a bookmarks manager that lets you add or remove single bookmarks. 
    
    - Added support for image/x-icon, image/x-xpixmap and image/x-xbitmap 
    image formats.
    
    - Changed the text entry field for the default path to a button which
    brings up a nice standard folder selection dialog.
    
    - The "Flip position of pages in double page mode" option, now called 
    "Manga mode", automatically aligns the scrollbars to the upper-right
    corner of the window when flipping to a new page.
    
    - The "Hide menubar etc. in fullscreen" option now also affects the 
    scrollbars.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused temporary files to be overwritten when viewing
    two archives in two different Comix sessions at the same time.
    
    - Fixed a bug which caused the separators in the menus to disappear after 
    a while.
    
    - Fixed a bug that caused the wrong page to be displayed when flipping 
    backwards one step in double page mode, switching to one page mode, 
    switching back to double page mode again and then flipping forward one 
    step, all with the cache option set.
    
    - Lots of minor fixes.

Comix 1.6

    - The next page can now be flipped to by pressing the left mouse button
    on the main window. Images can still be moved around by clicking and 
    dragging before you release the button again.
    
    - The "Hide cursor" option now only affect fullscreen.
    
    - Comix now sorts files by the standard set up by the LC_COLLATE
    environmental variable.
    
    - Added a new dialog to display an error message if the convert utility
    is used in some way to alter a file which the user does not have 
    appropriate permissions to.
    
    - Fixed a bug with the wrong filename sometimes being shown in the 
    properties dialog when viewing plain image files.
    
    - Fixed a bug with strange things happening when opening the
    preferences window in windowed mode and closing it in fullscreen mode
    and vice versa.
    
    - Fixed a bug with the "Hide menubar etc. in fullscreen" option not
    always working as expected.
    
    - Some minor fixes.

Comix 1.5

    - Added support for forward/back buttons on mice that have them.
    Thanks to Stephen Jones for this feature.
    
    - New option to set which filename extensions should be treated as 
    comment files.
    
    - New option to automatically hide menubar etc. when entering 
    fullscreen mode.
    
    - Improved the look of the properties dialog.
    
    - Fixed problems with parsing certain comment files.
    
    - Some minor fixes.

Comix 1.4

    - Added support for embedded archive comments in the form of .txt or 
    .nfo files.
    
    - The convert utility now creates exact copies of the directory structure
    in the source archive/directory, including correct filenames.
    
    - The zoom in and zoom out commands now zoom 15% relative to the
    current size instead of 20% relative to the original size.
    
    - Changed default image scaling quality to "Tiles" from "Hyper".
    
    - Some minor fixes.

Comix 1.3.1

    - Fixed a bug with old cached images sometimes being shown when a new
    archive/directory had been opened.

Comix 1.3

    - The viewed page(s) can now be dragged around by pressing the mouse
    button and moving the cursor.
    
    - New option to cache the next page for faster forward page flipping.
    Continuous backwards flipping will be slower with this option. Slightly
    more RAM will be used as well.
    
    - Comix now handles manipulation of already loaded images (resizing, 
    changing scaling technique, etc.) more efficiently due to less disk IO.
    
    - Fixed a bug that caused saved options to not be loaded when the 
    program is restarted.

Comix 1.2
    
    - Drag and drop support.
    
    - Changed the install.py script slightly.
    
    - Added new error messages for the statusbar when trying to open 
    non-valid files etc.

Comix 1.1.2

    - Applied a workaround for a bug(?) in newer versions of PyGTK, which made
    the OK button in the file selection dialog return the wrong value,
    rendering it useless. Thanks to neota for this solution.

Comix 1.1.1

    - The "file" dependancy is no longer needed. All mime type checks are now
    done internally.
    
    - Fixed an error in the .desktop file. 
    
    - The install.py script now uses "update-desktop-database" to update the 
    menus properly.
    
    - Some minor fixes.

Comix 1.1

    - Support for nestled archives, i.e. archives in archives.
    
    - The install.py script now includes a "--installdir" option to let the
    user choose the install directory, e.g. /usr instead of /usr/local.
    
    - Comix now includes a manpage.
    
    - Some minor fixes.

Comix 1.0.2

    - Added support for filenames encoded with various international 
    character encodings.
    
    - Some minor fixes.

Comix 1.0.1

    - Fixed a bug with the background colour option not working as expected
    on certain systems.

Comix 1.0

    - Added an archive convert feature. Archives and directories can be
    converted to Zip, tar, tar.gz or tar.bz2.
    
    - More changes toward a hopefully more user-friendly GUI.

Comix 0.9

    - A number of efforts has been made to make Comix more GNOME HIG 
    compliant.
    
    - Added optional menubar, toolbar and statusbar.
    
    - Added an option to hide the mouse cursor.
    
    - The space key now works in fit to screen mode as well.
    
    - Fixed a bug with certain hotkeys not working before the right-click menu
    had been shown the first time.
    
    - Fixed a bug with archive names sometimes being displayed incorrectly in
    the bookmarks menu.
    
    - Some minor fixes.

Comix 0.8

    - Comix now handles zip, tar, tar.gz and tar.bz2 archives 
    internally. The unzip and tar programs are no longer needed.
    
    - New option to let you go to the next archive when flipping past the 
    last page in the current archive, and vice versa for the first page.
    
    - Fixed a bug with small images sometimes being stretched to
    fit the screen although the corresponding option was not set.
    
    - Fixed a bug with exiting fullscreen mode with the escape key.
    
    - Supported image formats are now "only" JPEG, PNG, TIFF, GIF and BMP.
    There were problems with other files being reported as image files though
    they were not.
    
    - Some minor fixes.

Comix 0.7

    - Added a new "bookmark" feature.
    
    - Now reads any image format supported by gtk.gdk.Pixbuf (that
    means most formats).
    
    - Fixed a bug with capital letters not working as hotkeys.
    
    - Some minor fixes.

Comix 0.6

    - Added a new option to hide the scrollbars even when not in fit to
    screen mode.
    
    - Pressing space now scrolls the page to show the next part of it, if 
    pressed at the bottom of the page it flips to the next page.
    
    - Dialogs should now look better and use buttons with stock icons.
    
    - Scrolling could be a bit faulty due to different dimensions of the
    scrollbars in different themes. That problem is now fixed.
    
    - `Fit width', `Fit height' and `Fit to screen' commands should now be 
    exact.

Comix 0.5.2

    - The makefile in 0.5.1 could in some cases change the permissions
    of the folders Comix were installed in to 0755. To solve this 
    vulnerability Comix 0.5.2 uses a python script `install.py' to install 
    the program instead.
    
    Usage of the 0.5.1 makefile is not recommended!

Comix 0.5.1

    - Fixed a problem with the makefile. Destination directories will now
    be created if they do not already exist.

Comix 0.5

    - Fixed a bug with the background colour option not working.
    
    - Added a colour picking dialog instead of the old entry box for the
    background colour.
    
    - Added a new more user-friendly file chooser dialog.
    
    - Added `Fit width', `Fit height' and `Fit to screen' commands to the
    right-click menu.
    
    - Added new option to save zooming values to future sessions.
    
    - The right-click menu and the preferences window now looks better
    and should hopefully be more user friendly.
    
    - Changed some hotkeys and their effect.
    
    - PyGTK requirement is now 2.6+.

Comix 0.4

    - Comix now supports image zooming and window scrolling as well
    as the old fit-to-screen-mode.
    
    - Comix now includes a makefile, a .desktop file and an icon for an 
    easy installation and desktop integration.

Comix 0.3

    - New option to save window position and size to future sessions.
    
    - New option to set a default path to open when selecting a new file
    with the `Open file' command.
    
    - Comix now supports page scrolling with the mouse wheel.
    
    - Fixed a bug with trying to view `File info' when viewing the last page
    in double page mode.
    
    - Fixed a bug with the number of pages always reported as zero in the
    go-to-page-window.
    
    - Some minor fixes.

Comix 0.2.1

    - Fixed a bug with opening archives with 3+ files with the same name.

Comix 0.2

    - Now uses the shutil module to move and delete files instead
    of calling the `rm' and `mv' programs.
    
    - Now uses gtk.gdk.pixbuf_get_file_info() to check image file types
    and the `file' program to check filetypes for ZIP/RAR archives.
    Filename extensions should no longer matter for Comix.
    
    - Now supports tar, tar.gz and tar.bz2 archives.
    
    - New menu option `File info' brings up a window and displays various
    information about the file being viewed.
    
    - New option to flip the pages viewed in double page mode.
    
    - New option to reverse the reading order (start with the last page).
    
    - New option to set the saturation of the images displayed.
    
    - Some minor fixes.
    
    - New dependencies are `file' and `tar' (should be installed on most 
    systems as default).
